    "In the first assignment, you will familiarise yourself with matrix computations in NumPy. You must use operations on NumPy arrays, even if it would be possible to solve the exercises with simple multiplications, divisions, and loops. This will ensure that you get a feeling of how matrix operations and broadcasting works. If you are not familiar with these concepts, look at the interactive introduction to Python and the honey badger example.\n",
